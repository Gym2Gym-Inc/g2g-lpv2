# What are the potential risks of using Gym2Gym services?**

As with any physical activity, there are inherent risks associated. These could include but are not limited to injuries from improper use of equipment, overdoing exercises, or underlying health issues that can get aggravated due to strenuous activities.

Here are a few guidelines to mitigate these risks:

1. **Proper Instruction**: Always ensure you understand how to use each piece of equipment. If unsure, please ask one of our trained staff members for guidance.

2. **Health considerations**: Consult your healthcare provider before beginning any new exercise regimen. This is particularly important if you have any chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure.

3. **Know Your Limits**: Make sure to pace yourself and avoid pushing too hard too soon. Gradual progression is the key to avoiding injuries while improving fitness levels.

4. **Maintain Hygiene**: Given the shared nature of the equipment, always clean the equipment with wipes available at our gym after use. This reduces the risk of germs spread.

At Gym2Gym, we prioritize the safety and well-being of our members and strive to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable and safe.
